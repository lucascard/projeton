# Backend API Documentation

This is the backend of the my-vue3-project, built with TypeScript and Express. The backend serves as an API for the frontend application, providing necessary endpoints for data retrieval and manipulation.

## Project Structure

- **src/**: Contains the source code for the backend application.
  - **app.ts**: Entry point of the application, initializes the Express app and sets up middleware.
  - **routes/**: Contains route definitions.
    - **index.ts**: Defines API routes for the application.
  - **controllers/**: Contains request handling logic.
    - **index.ts**: Exports the main controller for handling requests.
  - **models/**: Defines data models used in the application.
    - **index.ts**: Exports classes or interfaces for database entities.
  - **config/**: Contains configuration files.
    - **database.ts**: Database connection configuration and initialization logic.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- npm

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd my-vue3-project/backend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up the TypeScript configuration:
   ```
   npx tsc --init
   ```

### Running the Application

To start the backend server, run:
```
npx ts-node src/app.ts
```

The server will start on the configured port, and you can access the API endpoints defined in the routes.

### API Endpoints

Refer to the `src/routes/index.ts` file for a list of available API endpoints and their descriptions.

## Database Configuration

The database connection settings can be found in `src/config/database.ts`. Ensure that your database is running and the connection details are correctly configured.
